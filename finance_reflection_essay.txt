Reflection Essay: The Most Interesting Thing I Learned About Money or Finance This Week

This week, the most interesting thing I learned about money is how it has evolved over time and the trust-based system that keeps it running. The TED-Ed video on the history of money explained how societies moved from bartering to using coins, paper money, and eventually digital currencies. It made me realize that money itself doesn’t have any real value—it’s just a symbol of trust. Without that trust, even the most widely accepted currency would be meaningless.

The Banking Explained – Money and Credit video was also eye-opening. It broke down how banks operate through fractional reserve banking, where they only keep a small portion of deposits and lend out the rest. I found it surprising that this system essentially creates new money through loans, making the entire financial system heavily dependent on trust and stability.

Looking ahead to 2025, I can see how these concepts will become even more relevant. With the rise of fintech, digital payments, and cryptocurrencies, money is becoming less physical and more abstract. Understanding how money works, especially in areas like lending, credit, and digital currencies, will be important as the financial landscape continues to change.
